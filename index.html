            The <strong>Future Histories Studio (FHS)</strong> is a new laboratory for emerging modes of arts-centered research, production, and presentation. It is an exploratory hub for those interested in hybrid inquiry and developing practice-based research at the intersections of art, technology, race, storytelling, and social justice. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The FHS experiments with art at the intersection of emerging technologies. Specific research areas include, but are not limited to artificial intelligence, blockchain, robotics, and bio-art inclusive of computer vision, data equity, community agreement, governance, and care. Emphasis is on art and knowledge production exploring concepts, questions, and intuitions through free study, practice, craft, tinkering, and collaboration with the aim of combating techno supremacy by modeling and alternative methodologies with the potential for tangible social impact.
